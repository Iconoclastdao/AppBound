# AppBound — MVP Bootstrap

This repository was generated by `bootstrap-mvp.js`. It contains a minimal production-minded scaffold for the AppBound MVP: smart contract, backend, frontend, and deploy/seed scripts.

## What was created

- `contracts/AppBoundLicense.sol` — ERC721 license contract (one license per user per `appId`).
- `scripts/deploy.js` — Hardhat deploy script (prints deployed address).
- `scripts/seed.js` — Mint a demo license to a test account (uses CONTRACT_ADDRESS in .env).
- `backend/` — Express backend that validates license on-chain and issues ephemeral JWT tokens.
- `frontend/` — Minimal Next.js app to connect MetaMask and check access.
- Root `package.json` with helper scripts.

## Required setup (do NOT skip)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```
   Or run root helper:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. Start a local Hardhat node in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

3. Deploy the contract to the local node (in a separate terminal — after step 2):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```
   This prints the deployed address. Copy that address into `backend/.env` as `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

4. Seed a demo license (optional, mints to the second Hardhat account):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/seed.js --network localhost
   ```
   Make sure `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is set in backend environment.

5. Start backend:
   ```bash
   node backend/index.js
   ```

6. Start frontend (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   # open http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Notes & Production Hardening

* **DO NOT** store private keys in plaintext. Use KMS/HSM for any signing operations in production.
* Add DB-backed nonces, signature flows, rate limiting, and CAPTCHA before enabling public minting or relayer services.
* Add HTTPS, helmet, CORS rules, logging, and monitoring to backend.
* Consider Wallet-as-a-Service (Web3Auth, Magic) or custodial workflows for non-crypto onboarding.
* Add tests: Hardhat unit tests, backend integration tests, and frontend E2E tests.

## Next steps (recommended)

* Add EIP-712 gasless mint (mintWithSig) + relayer.
* Add ERC-2981 royalty defaults and marketplace integration.
* Implement per-token AI instance provisioning or a shared backend with per-token quotas.
* Build SDK for third-party devs to integrate AppBound into their apps.

Happy building! — AppBound bootstrap
